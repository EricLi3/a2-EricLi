## The Best Todo List

What I made here is a simple, easy to use todo list application. A user enters 3 fields: Task title, Description of the task, and a Due date. The user will then click the "submit" button and see their task in the Todo list, along with a server derived field for days left.

CSS Positioning technique:
We have positioned the entire ui (user enter field and all tasks) in a container with flex display column direction. We also defined a max width for the container, allowing for some whitespace on the borders for easy viewing. The todo-form div is inside of this container and has content centered in it. The todo-table which lists all tasks currently on the server is given width 100% within the container for ckear display of relevant information.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:

I have created a single page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.
